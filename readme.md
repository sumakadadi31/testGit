## Pre-requisites
- HTML, CSS and JavaScript knowledge
- Very basic algorithms and data structures knowledge (traversing and using arrays, using objects in JavaScript)
- Bootstrap knowledge is a plus, but not necessary  
__Note__: Knowledge of Angular JS (Angular v1.x) or Angular 2/4 is NOT required.

## Software and Tools
- [VSCode used as IDE (editor) in the session](https://code.visualstudio.com/) - Download and install this. If you prefer another IDE, please continue using it. However, a simple editor like Notepad, or Notepad++ is NOT recommended.
- Extensions for VSCode IDE - VSCode extensions add third-party features into the IDE. From the VSCode menu choose View -> Extensions. Now you can search for the following extensions in the extensions marketplace, install them and reload the IDE (reloading is required to have the extensions start functioning). Once installed the documentation for using it can be viewed by selecting the extension in the installed list of extensions.

    - HTML CSS Support by ecmel
    - HTML Snippets by Mohamed Abusaid
    - Lorem ipsum by Daniel Imms
    - Path Intellisense by Christian Kohler
- Git CLI on participant systems and GitHub account for every participant(to be created individually by participant).  
Git CLI download: https://git-scm.com/downloads
GitHub link for account creation: https://github.com/join?source=header-home
 
 Once an account is created by everyone, the list of GitHub user names needs to be shared with me - I will add them to the GitHub repository before start of training.

- Node.js needs to be installed on all systems. This will also install npm. However, the proxy server details may need to be configured to enable npm access the npm registry (this registry is required to download Node modules required to build Node applications - Angular is available as node modules and hence the requirement).
Node.js https://nodejs.org/en/download/
To configure the proxy for npm these articles will be helpful: https://jjasonclark.com/how-to-setup-node-behind-web-proxy/
  
https://forum.freecodecamp.org/t/npm-behind-a-proxy-server/19386

- Optional download: It will save time if Angular CLI is installed before start of training. The details can be found here (only Step 1 / 4 - rest of steps are to create the Angular app and shall be done in the training)
https://cli.angular.io/

4. [Chrome Browser](https://www.google.com/chrome/browser/desktop/index.html) - Download and install this. Chrome has the best developer tools and is highly recommended for learning web development.
