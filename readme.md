## Software and Tools
- [VSCode used as IDE (editor) in the session](https://code.visualstudio.com/) - Download and install this. If you prefer another IDE, please continue using it. However, a simple editor like Notepad, or Notepad++ is NOT recommended.
- Extensions for VSCode IDE - VSCode extensions add third-party features into the IDE. From the VSCode menu choose View -> Extensions. Now you can search for the following extensions in the extensions marketplace, install them and reload the IDE (reloading is required to have the extensions start functioning). Once installed the documentation for using it can be viewed by selecting the extension in the installed list of extensions.
