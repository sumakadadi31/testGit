# RxJS - Reactive Extensions for JavaScript
* What RxJS is about
* Installing rxjs
* Importing rxjs - all functionality vs required functionality
* Creating an Observable (using Observer.from() and Observer.create) and an Observer and subscribing to an Observable
* Subscribing to an Observable without an explicit Observer class object
* Example: Using Observable.fromEvent() to listen to mouse events on document
